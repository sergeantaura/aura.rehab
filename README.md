# Aura Rehab

Static landing page for the Aura project, served directly from the repository root for GitHub Pages.

To view locally, open `index.html` in a browser or use a simple HTTP server:

```sh
python -m http.server 8000
```

Assets are referenced with root-relative paths so the page works from the GitHub Pages site generated from the `main` branch.
